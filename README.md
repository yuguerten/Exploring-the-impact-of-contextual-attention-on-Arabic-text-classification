# Exploring the Impact of the Attention Mechanism in Arabic Text Classification with AraBert

## About
This project investigates how the Attention mechanism improves Arabic text classification. It compares deep learning models, LSTM and CNN, that lack Attention, with AraBert, a Transformer model that utilizes Attention.

## Research Report
You can find the full research report on this project [here](./report.pdf).

## Dataset
Datasets used in the project can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ar-text-mining/files/Arabic-Corpora/):
- CNN Arabic news dataset: `cnn-arabic-utf8` (primary dataset)
- BBC Arabic news dataset: `bbc-arabic-utf8`

## Models
The following deep learning models were tested:
- **LSTM Model:** A Long short-term memory model for text classification.
- **CNN Model:** A convolutional neural network model for text classification.
- **AraBERT Model:** A transformer-based model specifically designed for Arabic text.

## Notebooks
